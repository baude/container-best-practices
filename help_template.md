# DESCRIPTION
Describe in greater detail the role or purpose of the image.  This can include more specifics about the packages that
make up the image.  You can also describe whether image is meant to be interactive or more service oriented.

# USAGE
Describe how to run the image as a container and what factors might influence the behaviour of the image itself.

# SECURITY IMPLICATIONS
If you expose ports or run with privileges, it would be warranted to briefly note those and provide an explaination
if needed.

# INSTALL
If the image needs to be installed (atomic install IMAGE), it should be noted here.  It would also be important
to mention any configuration files that the install process exposes that a user should customize.

# UNINSTALL
Describe how a user should remove a container based on this image.  If there are considerations beyond simply removing
the container, then they should be described here.

# UPDATE
When an updated image becomes available, it might be possible that users will need to take an explicit action after the
update has been completed.  Those actions should be described here.

# HISTORY
Similar to a Changelog of sorts which can be as detailed as the maintainer wishes.
